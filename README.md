# JsInfoSummaries.github.io
!Unfinished! <br>
Minimum width 307px <br>
This is a webpage that I made so I can easily find just the summarized part of a topic in Javascript.Info if ever I need to. <br>
Currently, the search button has no function yet. (Basically it doesn't work for now. In the future, yes.)<br>
This is public so anyone can use this but please credit me and also the creator of Javascript.Info <br>
Thank you!
