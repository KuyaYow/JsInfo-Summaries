!Unfinished!

Minimum width 307px
<br>
This is a webpage I made to provide the summarized information on various topics from JavaScript.info for quick reference.
<br>
<br>
Currently, the search button does not have a function yet. <br> (Basically it doesn't work right now. Though in the future I will make a function for it.)<br>
<br>
It's still not complete for the time being, I'll add more summaries whenever I can.
<br>
<br>
I've only tested the page on Chrome and Safari so far, and for some reason it's quite buggy on safari. I'll try my best to fix it and to test it on other browsers in the future
