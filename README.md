This is a webpage that I made so I can easily find just the summarized part of a topic <br> in Javascript.Info if ever I need to.
<br>
Currently, the search button has no function yet. <br> (Basically it doesn't work for now. Though in the future I will make a function for it.)<br>
For some reason it's very buggy on iPhones. <br> (I did tests on both Android and iPhone and it's just very buggy on iPhones but I'll try to fix it in the future.)<br>
